# Architecture overview

## Current runtime shape

```mermaid

  UI["React Native UI"]
  Brain["TypeScript Brain"]
  Kotlin["Kotlin Android layer"]
  Android["Android APIs"]
  LLM["LLM Runtime\nGemini, Anthropic, or local MediaPipe"]

  UI --> Brain
  Kotlin --> Brain
  Brain --> LLM
  Brain --> Kotlin
  Kotlin --> Android
  Android --> Kotlin
```

The Brain is TypeScript-first. Kotlin provides Android capabilities. Task reasoning belongs to an external agent. Jarvis is the device execution platform behind a gateway.

## Event-driven direction

```mermaid

  Android["Android callback"]
  Publisher["Native Event Publisher"]
  Bus["Event Bus"]
  Rule["Rule Engine"]
  State["World State"]
  Memory["Working Memory"]
  Context["Context Builder"]
  Planner["Planner"]
  Executor["Android Action Bridge"]

  Android --> Publisher --> Bus --> Rule
  Rule --> State
  Rule --> Memory
  State --> Context
  Memory --> Context
  Context --> Planner --> Executor --> Android
```

## Design principles

- Local-first where possible.
- Planner receives semantic context, not platform internals.
- Android capabilities are exposed through narrow bridge functions.
- Event sources can grow without rewriting the planner.
- App navigation should use current observation, visible text, semantic screen models, and UI state rather than hardcoded app flows.

## Current limitations

- React Native still owns the embedded Brain lifecycle in the current phase.
- Plugin lifecycle and permission negotiation APIs are not formalized.
- Long-term memory is scaffolded, not implemented.
- Wake word, vision, and autonomous behavior policies are planned, not complete.
